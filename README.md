Giffty is an open-source Secret Santa app created with React.JS that functions locally in your browser through the link: https://giffty-app.netlify.com.


# How does it work

You can set all guest list with their gift suggestions and approximate prices for free. No need for e-mails or accounts. Pairs results are always right, and you can even set Dark Pairs (read more about it below).

## No accounts or e-mails needed

After setting every detail, the pairs are generated and are shown to each person, passing the device to the name whom shows on the screen. 
> Note: If there's two or more guests with the same name, you might want to save their names in a way to identify each one.

## Gifts and prices

Desired gifts can be set by every guest, with the approximate price of it as well. The host can set a price limit so every desired gift stays on budget.

## Dark Pairs

Sometimes not everybody can be friends in a group, and that's okay. The Dark Pairs function allows the host to set a pair of guests who don't get along too well to prevent them from picking each other.

# Additional notes

Since the project still on its beta stage, some functions may not work as it's supposed to. And that's why I would like to ask you to open an issue everytime you find a bug or a malfunction.

## Issues

If you do find a bug, you can open an issue telling me with your best words what happened and, most importantly, **how it happened**. Then I'll do my best to fix it. :)


## Suggestions

Suggestions are welcome as well. If you have an idea of what could be added to the project or what could be improved, I would really like to know it.
> Some ideas may not work very well with the project, or may be to hard to develop, so I'm sorry if I can't make your suggestion come true. :(

## Donations

Even though the project is 100% free, you can always help me by sending a change. Any value will make me very happy. :)
> I haven't figured how to make it happen yet, so it may take a while.

### Thank you for reading all these. 🏵️
